# Image Classification with MNIST Fashion Dataset

## Project Overview

This project focuses on training a neural network model to classify images of clothing items using the MNIST Fashion dataset. The dataset includes grayscale images of various clothing types, such as sneakers and shirts, and serves as a practical example for image classification tasks.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Detailed exploration of the MNIST Fashion dataset, including loading, preprocessing, and visualizing the data.
- **Model Development**: Building and configuring a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify clothing images into predefined categories.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Training the CNN model on the MNIST Fashion training data and evaluating its performance on test data. Includes metrics like accuracy and loss.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of model predictions compared to actual labels to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: Framework for building and training the neural network model.
- **Keras**: High-level API for designing and implementing the CNN architecture.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Tool for creating visualizations of data and model predictions.
- **Pandas**: Library for data handling and preprocessing.
